* Creates a CSIDriver CRD (for the discovery and custom options of secrets store csi driver)
* Deploys the secrets store CSI driver with sidecar node-driver-registrar and liveness probe as a DaemonSet
* Creates a CRD for SecretProviderClass (objects of this kind will contain details of an external secret source and what secret(s) should be retrieved)
* Creates a CRD for SecretProviderClassPodStatus
* Creates a ClusterRole that allows accessing various secretsstore csi-related resources, and a service account bound to the ClusterRole. This SA is used by the secrets store CSI driver
